I would most gladly know the issue of it.\\n', '  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I make a broken delivery of the business; but the\\n', '    changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of\\n', \"    admiration. They seem'd almost, with staring on one another, to\\n\", '    tear the cases of their eyes; there was speech in their dumbness,\\n', \"    language in their very gesture; they look'd as they had heard of\\n\", \"    a world ransom'd, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder\\n\", '    appeared in them; but the wisest beholder that knew no more but\\n', \"    seeing could not say if th' importance were joy or sorrow- but in\\n\", '    the extremity of the one it must needs be.\\n', '\\n', '                    Enter another GENTLEMAN\\n', '\\n', '    Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more. The news, Rogero?\\n', \"  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfill'd:\\n\", \"    the King's daughter is found.

Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by\\n', \"    circumstance. That which you hear you'll swear you see, there is\\n\", \"    such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione's; her\\n\", '    jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with\\n', '    it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the\\n', '    creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness\\n', '    which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences-\\n', \"    proclaim her with all certainty to be the King's daughter. Did\\n\", '    you see the meeting of the two kings?\\n', '  SECOND GENTLEMAN. No.\\n', '  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen,\\n', '    cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown\\n', \"    another, so and in such manner that it seem'd sorrow wept to take\\n\", '    leave of them; for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up\\n', '    of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such\\n', '    distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour.\\n', '    Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found\\n', \"    daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy\\n\", \"    mother, thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces\\n\", '    his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping\\n', '    her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a\\n', \"    weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of\\n\", '    such another encounter, which lames report to follow it and\\n', '    undoes description to do it.\\n', '  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried\\n', '    hence the child?\\n', '  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Like an old tale still, which will have matter to\\n', '    rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was\\n', \"    torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd's son, who\\n\", '    has not only his innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but\\n', '    a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\\n', '  FIRST GENTLEMAN. What became of his bark and his followers?\\n', \"  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Wreck'd the same instant of their master's death,\\n\", '    and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments\\n', '    which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was\\n', \"    found. But, O, the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was\\n\", \"    fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin'd for the loss of her\\n\", \"    husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill'd. She\\n\", '    lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing\\n', '    as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be\\n', '    in danger of losing.\\n', '  FIRST GENTLEMAN. The dignity of this act was worth the audience of\\n', '    kings and princes; for by such was it acted.\\n', '  THIRD GENTLEMAN. One of the prettiest touches of all, and that\\n', \"    which angl'd for mine eyes- caught the water, though not the\\n\", \"    fish- was, when at the relation of the Queen's death, with the\\n\", \"    manner how she came to't bravely confess'd and lamented by the\\n\", '    King, how attentivenes wounded his daughter; till, from one sign\\n', \"    of dolour to another, she did with an 'Alas!'- I would fain say-\\n\", '    bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood.

Are they returned to the court?\\n', \"  THIRD GENTLEMAN. No. The Princess hearing of her mother's statue,\\n\", '    which is in the keeping of Paulina- a piece many years in doing\\n', \"    and now newly perform'd by that rare Italian master, Julio\\n\", '    Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into\\n', '    his work, would beguile nature of her custom, so perfectly he is\\n', '    her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say\\n', '    one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer- thither with\\n', '    all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend\\n', '    to sup.\\n', '  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I thought she had some great matter there in\\n', '    hand; for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since\\n', '    the death of Hermione, visited that removed house. Shall we\\n', '    thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?\\n', '  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Who would be thence that has the benefit of\\n', '    access?
